========

This site was built using HTML, CSS, Sass, Bootstrap, and Node (to automatically compile Sass and JS). 
Node does not need to be imported or installed for site to function properly.
The site was originally created in August of 2021, but was dramatically altered for this course.
The site was made to be responsive with Bootstrap, all other html files besides index were created,
site homepage layout was significantly changed. To pass validation checks, header tags were
changed so that an h1 tag is only followed by an h1 or h2 tag, and same for h2 and so on.

Validation Checker Results:
- The HTML checker rejected the correctly formatted stylesheet tag used to import the Google APIs.
- The HTML checker rejected the correct syntax for link to email in href.
- The accessibility checker flagged about.html, resume.html, and projects.html with "The contrast 
between the colour of the text and its background for the element is not sufficient to meer WCAG2.0 
Level AA" for particular text elements. Even when the background color is turned to white and the text
